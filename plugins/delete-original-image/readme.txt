Delete the original image file uploaded. Allow this to be done automatically on upload or do it in bulk for all your images.

== Description ==

Delete Original Image is a Wordpress plugin to delete the the original image file uploaded. The problem is that the original image file is ussualy huge (can be 6MB if it is a photograph) and it is never published on the pages so there is no need to keep it on your server.

The plugin gives you an option to enable/disable this to be done automatically when you upload an image. And/or you can do it in bulk for all your previously uploaded images.

Specifically, this plugin copy the 'large' image ( i.e: your-pic-1038x576.jpg ) to the original file path ( i.e.: your-pic.jpg ).

== Installation ==

1. Upload all files from this plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/delete-original-image` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Tools -> Delete Original Images

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will I have to re-insert the images on my posts?  =

No. The images used by wordpress are not touch. The plugin deletes the original file, that could only be used in case you need to re-generate the smaller images (In example if you want to remove a watermar you generated)
