wp-delete-original-image
========================

Delete Original Image is a Wordpress plugin to delete the the original image file uploaded. 
The problem is that the original image file is ussualy huge (can be 6MB if it is a photograph) and it is never published on the pages so there is no need to keep it on your server.

The plugin gives you an option to enable/disable this to be done automatically when you upload an image. And/or you can do it in bulk for all your previously uploaded images.

Specifically, this plugin copy the 'large' image ( i.e: your-pic-1038x576.jpg ) to the original file path ( i.e.: your-pic.jpg ).
